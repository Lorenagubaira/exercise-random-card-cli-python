![Random Card CLI Python](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-random-card-cli-python/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

In this project you will learn how to use coding logic to generate random cards.

## Instructions

Create an algorithm that randomly builds a random card every time it runs:

1. Start by cloning this repo: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-random-card-cli-python`
```

2. Run the algorithm by typing: 
```
python3 app.py
```

3. Every time the algorithm runs a new random card needs to show on the console.

4. The card must have one of the possible suites: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamonds.

5. The card value must be one of the following: 1 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace (no joker).

In the end, the project needs to look similar to [this demo](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-random-card-cli-python/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true).

### Hints

- You can use emoji for the card suites: `♡ ♧ ♤ ♢`
